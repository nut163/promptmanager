Shared Dependencies:

1. Database Schema: Both "Prompt.cs" and "Instruction.cs" will share the same database schema defined in "DatabaseManager.cs". The schema includes the tables "Prompts" and "Instructions" with fields such as ID, Title, Content, Timestamp for Prompts and ID, Prompt ID, Instruction Text, Timestamp for Instructions.

2. SQLite: The "DatabaseManager.cs" file will contain the SQLite connection and methods for CRUD operations. These methods will be used across multiple files like "Prompt.cs", "Instruction.cs", and "SearchFilter.cs".

3. Encryption and Access Control: The "Encryption.cs" and "AccessControl.cs" files will define methods for data encryption and access control. These methods will be used in "DatabaseManager.cs" for secure data storage and retrieval.

4. UI Elements: The XAML files ("MainWindow.xaml", "PromptWindow.xaml", "InstructionWindow.xaml") will define the UI elements. The corresponding .cs files ("MainWindow.xaml.cs", "PromptWindow.xaml.cs", "InstructionWindow.xaml.cs") will use these UI elements' IDs for event handling and data binding.

5. Search and Filter: The "SearchFilter.cs" file will define methods for searching and filtering prompts and instructions. These methods will be used in the UI files for displaying the search and filter results.

6. Data Import and Export: The "DataImportExport.cs" file will define methods for importing and exporting data. These methods will be used in the UI files for data management.

7. SQL Sanitizer: The "SQLSanitizer.cs" file will define methods for sanitizing SQL queries. These methods will be used in "DatabaseManager.cs" for preventing SQL injection.

8. Git: The ".gitignore" file will list the files and directories that Git should ignore. The "README.md" file will provide information about the project, which will be shared across the team through Git.

9. Main Entry Point: The "main.cs" file will be the main entry point of the application. It will use methods and classes defined in other files to run the application.
